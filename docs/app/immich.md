## How to use Immich

!!! warning "Immich requires BYO storage"
    You'll need to attach your own cloud storage to your ElfHosted stack, to take advantage of Immich. An excellent choice for attaching cloud storage is a [Hetzner Storagebox][storagebox], which can optionally be encrypted.

### Attach storage

Ensure you have a suitable BYO storage mount attached (confirm the location is browsable in [FileBrowser][filebrowser]) - a [Hetzner Storagebox][storagebox] is a good option if you don't already have cloud storage.

### Configure 

Use ElfBot to configure Immich to point to your mounted storage location, by running something like:

```
elfbot env immich IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION=/storage/storagebox-a/photos
```
