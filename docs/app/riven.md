# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Riven is a re-imagining of original functions of [plex-debrid][plex-debrid], enabling Plex-based torrent streaming through Real Debrid and 3rd party services like Overseerr, Mdblist, etc.

!!! tip "Riven gets revenue! :heart:"
    Riven is an "Elf-illiated" app - the devs are actively supporting users in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 100% of your subscriptions are contributed to the Riven devs to further development!

## How to use it

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHZAEhLuJqk?si=t5HJ5RT8UOfDDuXs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Unlike most ElfHosted apps, Riven is (currently) split into two - the frontend, and the backend:

### Meet the frontend UI

A lot of progress has been made on the frontend UI! It can be used for the entire on-boarding process, with the exception of the quality/ranking settings. These settings are currently configuired in the `settings.json` file found in `config/riven via [FileBrowser][filebrowser]. All of the other settings can be directly modified with the frontend UI, in addition to a number of Riven functions.

### Meet the backend

The Riven backend is what's functionally complete. On the backend, you'll see the logs displayed as Riven searches for your content, adds it to your RealDebrid library, symlinks it to `/storage/symlinks`, and updates Plex accordingly

To restart the backend, hit `CTRL-C` once in the ttyd/browser UI to terminate the process, and then hit `Enter` to reconnect to the session and watch it restart.

### Minimum requirements

At a minimum, Riven requires:

* [x] Your RealDebrid API key
* [x] A [claimed][elfbot] [Plex][plex] server
* [x] A [Plex token][plex-token]

And optionally, Riven will work with:

* [ ] An [Overseerr][overseerr] instance, for managing media requests
* [ ] A [Jackett][jackett] instance, to provide additional content scraping targets
* [ ] A [Prowlarr][prowlarr] instance, to provide additional content scraping targets
  
### Basic setup

#### Zurg

First and formost, you **must** first setup Zurg before any setup can be completed with Riven itself. 

1. Retrive your Real-Debrid API token via [their website](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken).
2. Navigate to Zurg's `config.yml` file found in `config/riven` via [FileBrowser][filebrowser].
3. Add your Real-Debrid token Zurg's `confiig.yml` file and save your changes.
4. Restart Zurg, either by using the Elfbot command `elfbot restart realdebird-zurg` or by deleting the pod for Zurg via [Kubernetes][kubernetes].

#### Plex

**Claim your Plex server:**

* See [this guide][plex-token] for instructions regarding claiming your Plex token.

**Create your Plex libraries:**

Using the Plex button on your Dashboard, go to your newly claimed Plex server.

1. Create a library for you Movies and set the path to `/storage/symlinks/movies/`.
2. Create a library for you TV Shows and set the path to `/storage/symlinks/shows/`.
   ***NOTE:*** *Make certain you are not enabling any of the features to generate thumbnails or intro/credit detection.*

#### Overseerr

  ***NOTE:*** *Some of the Overseerr setup is already done by default for new installations or following a reset of the Overseerr app.*

To integrate Overseerr with Riven, first setup Overseerr to integrate with Plex, and then...

1. Configure a webhook pointing to `http://riven:8080/webhook/overseerr`:

2. Enable your webhook for `Request Automatically Approved` and `Request Approved`:
