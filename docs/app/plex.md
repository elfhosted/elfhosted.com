# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Plex is a power media player with support across a large range of platforms

{% include 'app.md' %}
{% include 'app_access.md' %}

## How do I use it?

Use [ElfBot][elfbot] to apply your [plex claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim/), and reboot. Then access Plex from your dashboard.

You'll be prompted to setup your libraries, etc.

### From media players

When you configure the Plex app in your media player, use `https://<username>-plex.elfhosted.com` as the address (*if a port is required, use `443`*)

### Enable Hardware transcoding

Our nodes support Intel QuickSync for Video (QSV). If you're a PlexPass user, you can enable hardware transcoding.

## Solutions to common issues

### Can't add media libraries

If you find that you can't add media libraries, or even administer your Plex instance, then it probably hasn't been "claimed" yet. Use [ElfBot][elfbot] to claim your server using a claim code from https://www.plex.tv/claim/.

To confirm whether your Plex instance has been claimed, use [FileBrowser][filebrowser] to examine `config/plex//Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml`. If the server has been claimed, you'll see a key `PlexOnlineUsername`.

### Playback stalls

Plex may be trying to transcode the media, based on a detected incompatibilty with your client/app, and running into CPU limitations. For optimal performance and quality, try to direct-play media where possible. You could also try enabling hardware transcoding (*above*), which will improve transcoding performance.

### The transcoder exited due to an error.

This error will occur if Plex tries to transcode something in an inefficient way. ElfHosted nodes run a "[transcode-killer](https://github.com/funkypenguin/elf-infra/blob/ci/roles/node/files/kill-unwanted-transcodes.sh)" script which terminates such transcodes for the sake of the resources shared by other users.

Here are the transcodes we'll automatically terminate:

* Transcoding from HEVC to H264
* Transcoding video without using QSV (*PlexPass is required for hardware transcoding support*)
* Transcoding any 4K content (*even with QSV this is very resource-intensive - 4K should only be direct-played*)

### Database is corrupt

Certain unplanned events (power outages, etc) can result in Plex's database becoming corrupted. Fortunately, Plex makes its own, internal backup of its database at regular intervals, so it's possible to restore from a backed-up version of the database.

Here's the process to restore Plex to a database backup:

1. "Pause" Plex, using [ElfBot][elfbot]
2. In [FileBrowser][filebrowser], navigate to `config/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases`
3. Rename `com.plexapp.plugins.library.db` to `com.plexapp.plugins.library.db-corrupt`, and then pick the most recent, dated version of `com.plexapp.plugins.library.db-<date>`, and rename it to `com.plexapp.plugins.library.db`.

When Plex starts after the pause, the backup database will be used! :thumbsup:

### Remote Access issues

Plex may alert you that it is "Not available outside your network". This is to be expected, given that we're (a) accessing it via a reverse proxy, and (b) using a VPN to avoid Plex's global Hetzner ban. 

You'll still be able to access your Plex instance remotely via apps etc, provided that under `Settings` -> `Network` -> `Custom server access URLs`, you see your ElfHosted URL defined (*i.e. `https://<your username>-plex.elfhosted.com:443`*).

Note that when you connect to Plex externally, your port will be `443`, since your traffic arrives via our reverse proxy.

### Unable to save settings

Normally, Plex servers can be remotely administered using https://app.plex.tv - in our case, (maybe because we're using a VPN?), users have had inconsistent results saving server settings changes this way. To make changes to your Plex instance, use the `https://<your username>-plex.elfhosted.com` interface.
