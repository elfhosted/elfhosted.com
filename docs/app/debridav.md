# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Debridav is a small app written in Kotlin that emulates the qBittorrent and SABnzbd APIs and creates virtual files that are mapped to remotely cached files at debrid services, essentially acting as a download client that creates virtual file representations of remotely hosted files rather than downloading them. DebriDav exposes these files via the WebDav protocol so that they can be mounted.

!!! tip "Debridav gets revenue sharing! :heart:"
    Debridav is an "Elf-illiated" project - the developer maintains an active support channel ([#elf-debridav](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1327038603389567068)) in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 33% of your subscriptions are contributed to the developer!

## How do I use it?

The following guide indicates how to **add** Debridav to an existing, ElfHosted stack. To setup a new stack with Premiumize or EasyNews as your primary storage provider, refer to:

TBC

### Premiumize

To use Premiumize, you'll need an Premiumize account. ElfHosted currently have 14-day trial vouchers available for first-time Premiumize users. Reach out in [#elf-help][elf-help] if you'd like one!

Use [ElfBot][elfbot] to set the following environment variables:

```
elfbot env debridav PREMIUMIZE_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

#### Radarr / Sonarr

In each Aarr, add a new download client, of type qBittorrent. Set the name to `Debridav [PM/RD/EN]`, the URL to `http://debridav:8080`. No credentials are required. Set one of following categories `radarr,sonarr,radarr4k,sonarr4k,lidarr,readarr,readarraudio,prowlarr` (*avoid re-using the same category across multiple aars*).

Under `Settings` -> `Media Management` in your aars, show the advanced settings, and enable `Import Using Script`. Set the `Import Script Path` to `/elf-import.sh`

### EasyNews

To use EasyNews, you'll need an EasyNews account. You can get one for [as little as $2/month for the first year](https://signup.easynews.com/checkout/winback-deal-ae/).

Use [ElfBot][elfbot] to set the following environment variables:

```
elfbot env debridav DEBRIDAV_DEBRIDCLIENTS=easynews
elfbot env debridav EASYNEWS_PASSWORD=<your username>
elfbot env debridav EASYNEWS_USERNAME=<your password>
```

!!! tip "Using Premiumize and EasyNews simultaneously"
    It's possible to use both Premiumize **and** EasyNews, if you set:

    ```
    elfbot env debridav DEBRIDAV_DEBRIDCLIENTS=premiumize,easynews
    ```

#### Prowlarr

Add a custom Prowlarr indexer, of type `Generic Newznab`. Name it `ElfEasyNews` and set the URL to `http://debridav:5000`. Sync the indexer to your apps.

#### Radarr / Sonarr

In each Aarr, add a new download client, of type SabNZBD. Set the name to `Debridav [EN] (Usenet)`, the URL to `http://debridav:8080`, and enter anything for the API key. Set one of following categories `radarr,sonarr,radarr4k,sonarr4k,lidarr,readarr,readarraudio,prowlarr` (*avoid re-using the same category across multiple aars*).

![](/images/debridav-setup-2.png)

Under `Settings` -> `Media Management` in your aars, show the advanced settings, and enable `Import Using Script`. Set the `Import Script Path` to `/elf-import.sh`

![](/images/debridav-setup-4.png)

Unless you're using Debridav exclusively, you'll now have both a usenet (*ElfEasyNews*) indexer and a torrent indexer (*ElfZilean*). Under `Settings` -> `Profiles` -> `Delay Profiles`, you can control which type your Aar will prefer.

### Real Debrid

!!! warning
    The developer discourages RealDebrid users from using Debridav at present, until a significant bug has been resolved.

To use Debridav with RealDebrid, you'll need to set the `DEBRIDAV_DEBRIDCLIENTS` env var accordingly, like this:

```
elfbot env debridav DEBRIDAV_DEBRIDCLIENTS=real_debrid
```

You'll also need to set your RD API key, like this:

```
elfbot env debridav REAL-DEBRID_APIKEY=<your key>
```

### Where's my content?

The **actual** files are "downloaded" to `/storage/debridav/symlinked` (*moved there by the `elf-import.sh` script*), but you should continue to point your libraries (and your root media folders) to `/storage/symlinks/..`.
