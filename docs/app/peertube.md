## How do I use it?

### Set PEERTUBE_SECRET

PeerTube won't start without a `PEERTUBE_SECRET` ENV var, which needs to be set by the user.

Generate a 64-character hexidecimal string (*`openssl rand -hex 32` for example*), and then applying it to PeerTube using [ElfBot][elfbot]:

```
elfbot env peertube PEERTUBE_SECRET=whateveryousetmakesureits64charshexidecimalonly
```
