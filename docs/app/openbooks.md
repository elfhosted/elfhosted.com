# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Openbooks allows you to download ebooks from irc.irchighway.net quickly and easily.

{% include 'app.md' %}
{% include 'app_access.md' %}

### Where are my downloaded books?

The app saves books to `/tmp` by default, but this can by adjusted to use a storage mount by passing the `DATA_DIR` env var using [ElfBot][elfbot], like `elfbot env openbooks DATA_DIR=/storage/storagebox-a/media/ebooks`, for example.
