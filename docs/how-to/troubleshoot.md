# Troubleshoot

This page outlines some common troubleshooting techniques you'd use to work out why your ElfHosted apps are not working - i.e., some "Elf-Service".

## ElfBot

[ElfBot][elfbot] can be used to safely restart your apps, or create backups for later retrieval and archive. 

## Kubernetes Dashboard

If ElfBot is a spoon, then [Kubernetes Dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard] is a hammer! Using dashboard, you can examine your pods CPU/RAM usage, node placement, and critically, see the **running, real-time logs** of each container in your pod!

Deleting a pod using Kubernetes Dashboard will have the same effect as using ElfBot - the pod will be deleted, and Kubernetes will quickly schedule a replacement.
