# What are ElfPoints?

"ElfPoints" are our loyalty / reward currency, intended to reward our subscribers for long-term subscriptions, and to provide credit for extra apps to [streaming bundle](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/) subscribers.

You "[earn](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_woorewards/)" ElfPoints every time you spend money, or completing other promotional activities.

## Earn ElfPoints

### Earn 20% back on every renewal

With each subscription renewal, you’ll receive ElfPoints worth 20% of its value, automatically added to your [ElfPoints Wallet](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_wallet/). You can then use those points to purchase a new subscription or renew an existing one.

### Earn $5 for every review

For every [review](/how-to/leave-a-review/) you post of a product you've purchased, we'll credit you with 500 ElfPoints (*$5 spendable credit*), up to twice per month.

### Earn for every referral

Every time you use our [pay-it-forward referral system](https://store.elfhosted.com/pay-it-forward/), you [earn ElfPoints](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_woorewards/), when your referrees click, register, or spend.

### Earn for being awesome!

We'll award you 1000 ElfPoints (*$10 credit*) on the anniversary of your registration. Happy ElfBirthday! :cake:
