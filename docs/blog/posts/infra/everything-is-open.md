# We are an Open (Source) Startup!

No technical / infrastructure changes today, but one of the most significant - as [originally stated](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/396055506663374849/1121299165448781854), I've moved our infrastructure code(*GitOps and ansible*) and helm charts into public repos, and created a "[open](https://elfhosted.com/open/)" page to coallate all the publically shared information.

## Why be so open?

I'm betting that the value gained by community-building, with transparency and goodwill, will outweigh any value lost by sharing the "sekrit sauces" which make ElfHosted work, such that a motivated user could "roll it themselves".

## r/selfhosted 💔 ElfHosted?

Having finished polishing the open source pages above, I (*bravely/foolishly*) [invited r/selfhosted to trial / submit feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/15a0c82/inviting_you_to_try_elfhosted/?sort=new).

I immediately got feedback, but it wasn't as positive as I'd hoped! (*leopards ate my face again!*) The process was useful though, in terms of working out how (*or how not!*) to try to find more users / testers!

(*Ideas about more ways to gain exposure are welcome!*)

## Today's scoreboard

Thanks for building with us - stay tuned!
