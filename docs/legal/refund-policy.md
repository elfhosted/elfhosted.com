# Refund Policy

## Trial Periods vs refunds

ElfHosted provide generous 7-day trial packages of our apps, starter, and Hobbit bundles. The intention of these trial periods is to afford users ample time to discover the platform, and to determine whether it's a "fit" for them.

With this goal in mind, ElfHosted will not issue refunds for "unsuitability" of the platform, if users "change their mind" during their subscription term. If the platform is unsuitable, users should have discovered this within their 7-day trial period.

Packages without trials periods (*Rangers, Halflings, Nazguls*) are not eligible for discretionary refunds. Users wanting to "test the waters" should start on a trial package and upgrade to a larger package when they're satisfied and willing to commit. Refunds will not be offered for non-trial packages.

## Promotions

From time to time, ElfHosted will offer discounted pricing on subscriptions. These promotions are intended to attract new users at the cost of revenue, and refunds will **not** be offered on a subscription due to a price difference between the amount paid and any promotional price.

## Cancellation

A cancelled subscription will persist until the subscription renewal date, in a "pending-cancel" state, but won't be renewed.

A cancelled trial will immediately be terminated, but can be re-activated for the duration of the trial period.

## Refunds

While we reserve the right to make exceptions to this rule based on individual circumstances, refunds are intended for instances when ElfHosted is entirely responsible for the unsuitability of a service, for example, the withdrawl of a particular application or product.

While ElfHosted will, in good faith, attempt to resolve issues, events outside of ElfHosted's direct control, such as policy or technical changes to 3rd parties (*Plex, RealDebrid, etc*) which render the service unusable, will **not** constitute grounds for a refund.

## No Refunds

To be clear, the following are example cases under which you will **not** receive a refund:

* Your cloud provider (*RealDebrid, AllDebrid, etc*) bans your account
* Plex block our IP / VPN ranges
* RealDebrid makes technical changes which renders the service unusable
* You replace your smart TV and streaming no longer works well
* Our datacenter providers suspend services or make changes which render the service unusable (*in this case, we would in good faith, move services to alternative providers*)
* There is a price difference between the amount paid and any promotional price
* You "changed your mind" or believe, post-purchase, that the product is not "fit to purpose"
* Your subscription was automatically renewed due to not cancelling the subscription before the renewal date
* You are unwilling or unable to cooperate with the ElfHosted support team in providing necessary information for troubleshooting in a timely manner
* You only have a smartphone, but the apps you're using require a desktop / laptop browser
